// When I'm not coding, I love hanging out with my dog Lola, cooking, baking,
// playing scrabble, and listening to true crime podcasts.

// Before becoming a software engineer I worked for five years in the non
// profit sphere, doing fundraising, grant writing, and other development
// activities for colleges, a private high school, and a federally funded
// medical clinic.
